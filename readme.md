## About Project

This project was developed as to answer question provided to develop a web-based application using PHP with the below Requirements:

1.       Create a web application to record:

o  <ul><li> A list of people (first name, surname, date of birth, age (calculated field)).</li>

o  <li> A list of attribute types e.g. Height, Hair Colour, Weight etc.  These should not be hardcoded but a list the user can add / edit and delete.</li>

o   <li>Ability to link one or more attributes with a corresponding value when editing a person.</li></ul>

2.       The list of people must use a Bootstrap compatible grid to display data, sortable and filterable on first name, surname.

3.       Grid data must be fetched via an Ajax request (not loaded into the initial page and then tabulated).

4.      Create / Edit / Delete on each line either via their own pages or via modal popup.
